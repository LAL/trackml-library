TrackML utility library
=======================

A python library to simplify working with the
[High Energy Physics Tracking Machine Learning challenge][trackml]
dataset. It can be used for the datasets of both the
[accuracy phase][trackml_kaggle] and the
[throughput phase][trackml_codalab].

Installation
------------

The package can be installed as a user package via

    pip install --user <path/to/repository>

To make a local checkout of the repository available directly it can also be
installed in development mode

    pip install --user --editable <path/to/local/checkout>

In both cases, the package can be imported via `import trackml` without
additional configuration. In the later case, changes made to the code are
immediately visible without having to reinstall the package.

Usage
-----

To read the data for one event from the training dataset including the ground
truth information:

```python
from trackml.dataset import load_event

hits, cells, particles, truth = load_event('path/to/event000000123')
```

For the test dataset only the hit information is available. To read only this
data:

```python
from trackml.dataset import load_event

hits, cells = load_event('path/to/event000000456', parts=['hits', 'cells'])
```

To iterate over events in a dataset:

```python
from trackml.dataset import load_dataset

for event_id, hits, cells, particles, truth in load_dataset('path/to/dataset'):
    ...
```

To read a single event and compute additional columns derived from the
stored data:

```python
from trackml.dataset import load_event
from trackml.utils import add_position_quantities, add_momentum_quantities, decode_particle_id

# get the particles data
particles = load_event('path/to/event000000123', parts=['particles'])
# decode particle id into vertex id, generation, etc.
particles = decode_particle_id(particles)
# add vertex rho, phi, r
particles = add_position_quantities(particles, prefix='v')
# add momentum eta, p, pt
particles = add_momentum_quantities(particles)
```

The dataset path can be the path to a directory or to a zip file containing the
events `.csv` files. Each event is lazily loaded during the iteration. Options
are available to read only a subset of available events or only read selected
parts, e.g. only hits or only particles.

To generate a random test submission from truth information and compute the
expected score:

```python
from trackml.randomize import shuffle_hits
from trackml.score import score_event

shuffled = shuffle_hits(truth, 0.05) # 5% probability to reassign a hit
score = score_event(truth, shuffled)
```

All methods either take or return `pandas.DataFrame` objects. You can have a
look at the function docstrings for detailed information.

Dataset
-------

A dataset comprises multiple independent events, where each event
contains simulated measurements (essentially 3D points) of particles
generated in a collision between proton bunches at the
[Large Hadron Collider][lhc] at [CERN][cern]. The goal of the tracking
machine learning challenge is to group the recorded measurements or hits
for each event into tracks, sets of hits that belong to the same initial
particle. A solution must uniquely associate each hit to one track. The
training dataset contains the recorded hits, their ground truth
counterpart and their association to particles, and the initial
parameters of those particles. The test dataset contains only the
recorded hits.

Each dataset is usually provided as a single archive file. Once
unzipped, the dataset comprises a set of `.csv[.gz]` files. Each event
can have up to four associated files that contain hits, hit cells,
particles, and the ground truth association between them. The common
prefix, e.g. `event000000010`, is always `event` followed by 9 digits.

    event000000000-hits.csv
    event000000000-cells.csv
    event000000000-particles.csv
    event000000000-truth.csv
    event000000001-hits.csv
    event000000001-cells.csv
    event000000001-particles.csv
    event000000001-truth.csv

Submissions must be provided as a single `.csv` file for the whole
dataset, e.g.

    submission-test.csv
    submission-final.csv

### Event hits

The hits file contains the following values for each hit/entry:

*   **hit_id**: numerical identifier of the hit inside the event.
*   **x, y, z**: measured x, y, z position (in millimeter) of the hit in
    global coordinates.
*   **volume_id**: numerical identifier of the detector group.
*   **layer_id**: numerical identifier of the detector layer inside the
    group.
*   **module_id**: numerical identifier of the detector module inside
    the layer.

The volume/layer/module id could in principle be deduced from x, y, z. They
are given here to simplify detector-specific data handling.

### Event truth

The truth file contains the mapping between hits and generating particles and
the true particle state at each measured hit. Each entry maps one hit to one
particle.

*   **hit_id**: numerical identifier of the hit as defined in the hits file.
*   **particle_id**: numerical identifier of the generating particle as defined
    in the particles file. A value of 0 means that the hit did not originate
    from a reconstructible particle, but e.g. from detector noise.
*   **tx, ty, tz** true intersection point in global coordinates (in
    millimeters) between the particle trajectory and the sensitive surface.
*   **tpx, tpy, tpz** true particle momentum (in GeV/c) in the global
    coordinate system at the intersection point. The corresponding vector
    is tangent to the particle trajectory at the intersection point.
*   **weight** per-hit weight used for the scoring metric; total sum of weights
    within one event equals to one.

### Event particles

The particles files contains the following values for each particle/entry:

*   **particle_id**: numerical identifier of the particle inside the event.
*   **particle_type**: numerical identifier of the particle type; the
    [Particle Data Group Monte Carlo numbering scheme][pdg_mc_numbering]
    is used to identify specific particle types.
*   **vx, vy, vz**: initial position or vertex (in millimeters) in global
    coordinates.
*   **px, py, pz**: initial momentum (in GeV/c) along each global axis.
*   **q**: particle charge (as multiple of the absolute electron charge).
*   **nhits**: number of hits generated by this particle.

All entries contain the generated information or ground truth.

### Event hit cells

The cells file contains the constituent active detector cells that comprise each
hit. The cells can be used to refine the hit to track association.
A cell is the smallest granularity inside each detector module, much like a
pixel on a screen, except that depending on the **volume_id** a cell can be a square
or a long rectangle. It is identified by two channel identifiers that are unique
within each detector module and encode the position, much like column/row
numbers of a matrix. A cell can provide signal information that the detector
module has recorded in addition to the position. Depending on the detector type
only one of the channel identifiers is valid, e.g. for the strip detectors, and
the value might have different resolution.

*   **hit_id**: numerical identifier of the hit as defined in the hits file.
*   **ch0, ch1**: channel identifier/coordinates unique within one module.
*   **value**: signal value information, e.g. how much charge a particle has
    deposited.

### Dataset submission information

The submission file must associate each hit in each event to one and only one
reconstructed particle track. The reconstructed tracks must be uniquely
identified only within each event.

*   **event_id**: numerical identifier of the event; corresponds to the number
    found in the per-event file name prefix.
*   **hit_id**: numerical identifier of the hit inside the event as defined in
    the per-event hits file.
*   **track_id**: user-defined numerical identifier (non-negative integer) of
    the track.

### Additional detector geometry information

The detector is built from silicon slabs (or modules, rectangular or
trapezo√Ødal), arranged in cylinders and disks, which measure the position (or
hits) of the particles that cross them. The detector modules are organized
into detector groups or volumes identified by a **volume_id**. Inside a volume they
are further grouped into layers identified by a **layer_id**. Each layer can contain
an arbitrary number of detector modules, the smallest geometrically distinct
detector object, each identified by a **module_id**. Within each group, detector
modules are of the same type have e.g. the same granularity. All simulated
detector modules are so-called semiconductor sensors that are build from thin
silicon sensor chips. Each module can be represented by a two-dimensional,
planar, bounded sensitive surface. These sensitive surfaces are subdivided into
regular grids that define the detectors cells, the smallest granularity within
the detector.

Each module has a different position and orientation described in the detectors
file. A local, right-handed coordinate system is defined on each sensitive
surface such that the first two coordinates u and v are on the sensitive surface
and the third coordinate w is normal to the surface. The orientation and
position are defined by the following transformation

    pos_xyz = rotation_matrix * pos_uvw + offset

that transform a position described in local coordinates u,v,w into the
equivalent position x,y,z in global coordinates using a rotation matrix and
an offset.

*   **volume_id**: numerical identifier of the detector group.
*   **layer_id**: numerical identifier of the detector layer inside the
    group.
*   **module_id**: numerical identifier of the detector module inside
    the layer.
*   **cx, cy, cz**: position of the local origin in the described in the global
    coordinate system (in millimeter).
*   **rot_xu, rot_xv, rot_xw, rot_yu, ...**: components of the rotation matrix
    to rotate from local u,v,w to global x,y,z coordinates.
*   **module_t**: thickness of the detector module (in millimeter).
*   **module_minhu, module_maxhu**: the minimum/maximum half-length of the
    module boundary along the local u direction (in millimeter).
*   **module_hv**: the half-length of the module boundary along the local v
    direction (in millimeter).
*   **pitch_u, pitch_v**: the size of detector cells along the local u and v
    direction (in millimeter).
